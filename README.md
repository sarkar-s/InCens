Information transfer in Central Dogma systems

This package contains python3 scripts and jupyter notebooks to compute the ideal and the protein-level channel capacity for central dogma reaction networks. The documentation is available at, https://incens.readthedocs.io/en/latest/.

Notebook for computing the ideal channel capacity is, Computation_of_ideal_channel_capacity.ipynb.

Notebook for performing Gillespie (kinetic Monte Carlo) simulation of central dogma reactions is, Central_dogma_simulator.ipynb.

Notebook for plotting the distribution of integration times for the four species is, Integration_time_of_species.ipynb.

The transcript and protein half-lives for the four species are in folder ./half-lives.

The central dogma rate constants for the four species are in ./scripts/simulation_data.py.
